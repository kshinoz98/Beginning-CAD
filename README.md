## Swing Arm

### Description

Based on a series of sketches, model a part and measure the mass. Then, using variables, change the dimensions of the design

## Multi-Part Studio

### Description

Based on a series of sketches, and using only one part studio, create a model and weigh it. After that, the assignment instructed us to change a few constraints, which would change different dimensions across the whole part studio.

#4.1 - Teamwork Makes the Dream Work!

### Description

In the Unit 4 assignments, I was student B. For the most part, the only thing I had to do was to

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

#4.2 - Key & Prop

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.
