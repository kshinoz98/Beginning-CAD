# Swing Arm
### Description
In this assignment, I had to create a model based on a series of drawings and measure the mass. Then, using variables, change the dimensions of the design and weigh again.The learning goal in this assignment was to learn how to use constraints to create a sketch from drawings.

### Reflection
This assignment was actually quite hard, as this was my first time reading from drawings, and the cross sections still perplex me. In addition I usually don't have troubles with the constraints, but how I made this, it was counterintuitive to how I normally make a sketch. I still have a lot to learn about drawing notation, but I have learned a few things:
* **Typ** means that the constraint refers to other similar sketch parts as well
* **Underlined** means the dimension is not to scale
* There are often things that are not explicitly stated on a drawing which you can assume as true

If I did this assignment again, I would take some time just looking at the isometric drawing, thinking of the best way to build it instead of jumping right into the dimensions and constraints. This would have saved me a lot of time, as eventually I had to go back and do that, but I wasted a lot of time before I got to that point.

## Multi-Part Studio

### Description
In this assignment I created a model based on a series of sketches using only one part studio, and then weighed it. After that, the assignment instructed us to change a few constraints, which would change different dimensions across the whole part studio. This assignment was focused on the usefulness of a multi-part studio, specifically how you can create parts that are constrained to other part without having to manually change the dimensions.

### Reflection
This assignment was less helpful to me, as I had already been doing multi-part studios for a while. However, one thing that I did have to learn was how to cope with a design intent as outlined on a drawing. I did not notice these on the first drawings, and skipped straight to the sketches. This is what I usually do when I get a whole line of drawings, but in this case, and also in [Swing Arm](#Swing_Arm), the information on the first pages was important to the assignment. Eventually, this ended in me having to go back and redo some of my work.

# PullCopter [4.1-4.5]

### Description

In this assignment, I followed the instructions to construct, constrain and finally animate a usable spin copter. In the Unit 4 assignments, I was student B so I constructed the spinner and the prop. The focus of this assignment was cooperation in a onshape doc, as well as learning how to use features like helix, circular pattern, sweep and versions.

## 4.1 - Teamwork Makes the Dream Work!

### Reflection
I didn't learn too much in this portion of the assignment, because I had used the helix and circular pattern tools before. However, I did take something away from this assignment, which is to use more sketches. I had a way of trying to use one sketch for almost everything at that time, and since then I have tried to use more sketches, emulating the way that they were used in this assignment.

## 4.2 - Key & Prop

### Reflection

This portion of the assignment was very similar to 4.1, in that it did not add much to my knowledge. However, there are a few small things that I could use in the future, one of which is the extrude to face tool, which I did not know existed, but I always wanted. Second is keybinds which helped me do this assignment as fast as possible.

## 4.3 - Assembling the Launcher

### Reflection

In this portion of the assignment, I was instructed to put together the parts made in the previous steps. It was not too difficult, and I had used most of the mates before. However, I also came up with a quick trick to find how far the pinion should move per each revolution, I used this formula: D*Pi, where D is the diameter of the gear. Also, I did not know about that I could turn perspective on and off until I did this assignment, and I will use perspective in the future when I take Screenshots.

## 4.4 & 4.5

### Reflection

This was by far the most interesting part of the Assignment. I learned a lot in 4.4, because I really did not know that much about versions, and how much you could do in onshape with versions. I learned:
**You can create a workspace from a version
**You can merge edits between different versions(Which I'm very happy about)
**You can go through every single feature's history and go back to any place you have been before

In reference to 4.5, I didn't actually print, but I downloaded the files and found the place where I could have put it, which seems self explanitory.

# Onshape Assemblies
### Description
In this assignment, I had to follow instructions, and listen to people drone on about Onshape mates.

### Reflection
This assignment was not that hard, as I mostly knew about the things they talked about. Explicit mates are basically mates attached in a part studio that can be attached in context to other parts based in the part studio, or mates that are based off the geometry of the part, but not on a geometry node(ie between, displaced). The other thing that we were supposed to learn about was the triad manipulators, which basically made sense, but I did learn that you could change the base of the triad manipulator with mate connectors, as well as move it to the orgin.

### Reflection

Despite the pressure, I found the CAD test to be a valuable learning experience. It forced me to apply my knowledge of CAD and technical drawing conventions in a time-constrained setting, which helped to give a taste of what might happen at a job. In terms of being prepared, I feel like I was definitely ready, though I didn't really realize how much pressure I would feel while doing the test. It's a lot scarier when it's happening, and I definitely made a lot of mistakes that I shouldn't have made. To break it down further, the modeling section is basically how good your google skills are, and the modeling is how well you can interpret sketches and strange diagrams within a time limit. Overall, I believe it helped, as I learned a lot of the nuance of Onshape in the practice.
